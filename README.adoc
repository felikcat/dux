== About
.This Arch Linux installer's primary goals.
[%collapsible]
====
- Tunnel-visioned on maintaining a stable OS, such as using Btrfs snapshots automatically.

- Has some desktop & gaming optimizations that ArchInstall and ArchTitus fail to do themselves, the ladder two being optimized for servers instead (Linux defaults).

- Kept simple and programmed in Bash.

- There's customizability, but only if important.
** It's one way or the highway intentionally. If you don't like parts of Dux, you can change that after the fact, as a regular Arch Linux user would.
*** Chasing immense customizability will lead to bugs and user error. If you want that, use ArchInstall or Archboot instead.

- No third-party repos that break the OS, unlike Manjaro.

- systemd services are avoided whenever possible, as they are lower-quality than alternatives.

- What's used is what is the most pragmatic, which is currently KDE. Historically there was a https://gist.github.com/felikcat/ae4d80bd6af49f336b0bbd3bb15bc469[GNOME installer].
====

.If you're going to use Dux, three rules to keep in mind:
. The installer itself will break likely every few months, due to Arch maintainers renaming a package. You are expected to fix issues if I don't get around to it quickly enough.

. This installer is a way to setup Arch Linux faster, in a high-quality manner, and is resilient against breakage from updates; given you know how to use Btrfs snapshots.

. Dual-booting is supported, but only if that OS (likely Windows) is on a separate disk/drive.


== 1. Requirements

. If you do not meet the GPU requirements, use `disable_gpu="1"` to manually install and configure yourself:
- For AMD: Radeon RX 460 or newer.
- For NVIDIA: GeForce GTX 745 or newer.
- For Intel: HD 3000 or newer.

. *UEFI* must be enabled.
** If booting into the Arch Linux ISO fails on UEFI, a very rare IA32 UEFI BIOS is used. Follow link:https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Booting_64-bit_kernel_on_32-bit_UEFI[these instructions] to successfully boot the Arch Linux ISO.
. link:https://archive.is/QwLMB[Disable UEFI Secure Boot]
** If convincing is needed, link:https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/wiki/FAQ#Why_do_I_need_to_disable_Secure_Boot_to_use_UEFINTFS[read this].

. *2GB* of RAM; 4GB recommended.
. If you have *16GB* of RAM, *32GB* of storage is required; *32GB* RAM would require *48GB* of storage.

NOTE: Dual-booting is not supported, run Windows or whatever else through a QEMU virtual machine -- which helpers and instructions are provided for this.


== 2. Verify ISO authenticity

.Download the latest link:https://archlinux.org/download/[Arch Linux ISO]; if you have no torrent client, use link:https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php[qBittorrent].
- Keep that tab open.

=== macOS
. Install Homebrew from https://brew.sh/
. `brew install gnupg`
. Follow the Linux instructions below.

=== *Windows*
. Install https://gpg4win.org/thanks-for-download.html[GnuPG] using its latest simple installer: +
image:GPG/firefox_4EiWmbJfJo.png[480,360]
. Open a Terminal or PowerShell in the directory of `gpg.exe`: +
image:GPG/explorer_sIHtC1HEcI.png[480,360]
. Follow the Linux instructions below.

=== Linux
. NOTE: The full key (not short or long) is used to fully protect against collision attacks. +
`gpg --auto-key-locate clear,wkd -v --locate-external-key pierre@archlinux.org`

. Download the "ISO PGP signature" from https://archlinux.org/download/[here].

. `gpg --full-gen-key`
```
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (9) ECC (sign and encrypt) *default*
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? ↵

Please select which elliptic curve you want:
   (1) Curve 25519 *default*
   (4) NIST P-384
   (6) Brainpool P-256
Your selection? ↵

Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) ↵
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: dux
Email address: dux@dux.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "dux <dux@dux.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
```

. After your new GPG key has been generated, show its full key; [ultimate] indicates that you trust this key ultimately (you created the key), which is the desired behavior. +
`gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format none`

. Sign Arch's GPG key with yours. +
`gpg --sign-key 3E80CA1A8B89F69CBA57D98A76A5EF9054449A5C`

. Verify if the ISO is authentic, and its file integrity doesn't fail (indicates a broken download). +
`gpg --verify /path/to/archkbd:[TAB].sig`

== 3. Format a USB with the Arch Linux ISO
WARNING: This will destroy all previous data on the targeted device!

=== Windows
First choice is to use https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases[balenaEtcher].

.Second choice (Rufus)
[%collapsible]
====
. Download and install rufus-$version.exe +
https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/releases

. Add the Arch ISO then copy the following settings: +
image:rufus-4.2_NDydafPQE3.png[480,360]

. Click Start, then use "Write in ISO -> ESP mode".

====

=== macOS and Linux
Use https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases[balenaEtcher].

.dd method (not recommended)
[%collapsible]
====
. Thoroughly list disks and partitions; to see what disk/drive you are going to format. +
`$ lsblk -o PATH,MODEL,PARTLABEL,FSTYPE,FSVER,SIZE,FSUSE%,FSAVAIL,MOUNTPOINTS`

. Do not append numbers to the end of /dev/EXAMPLE +
`# dd if=/path/to/archkbd:[TAB] of=/dev/EXAMPLE bs=8M oflag=direct status=progress`
====

=== OpenBSD
. List all available disks: +
`$ dmesg|egrep '^([cswf]d). '` or `$ df -h`

. List the partitions of a disk, and show sizes in gigabytes (-p g): +
`# disklabel -p g EXAMPLE`

. Do not append numbers to the end of /dev/EXAMPLE: +
`# dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archkbd:[TAB] of=/dev/EXAMPLE conv=sync`


== 4. Starting the Dux installer

Once booted into the Arch Linux ISO, ensure an internet connection is established. +
`$ ping archlinux.org`

.No connection?
[%collapsible]
====

*For Wi-Fi:*

. Run `# rfkill unblock all`
. `# iwctl` -> `station wlan0 connect your_wifi_SSID` -> `exit`
. `# systemctl restart systemd-networkd`

TIP: If "wlan0" is not the correct interface, use iwctl's `station list` to see your wireless interface(s).

*https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mmcli[For mobile modems]*.

====


. `# pacman-key --init`
. `# pacman -Syy git`
. `# git clone https://github.com/felikcat/dux`

. Open `~/dux/src/Configs/settings.sh` in your editor of choice, likely `vim` or `nano`
** Do not remove options in Dux's configs! Disable them.

. `# bash ~/dux/src/format_disk.sh`
** kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[C] to exit the disk formatter if you're not comfortable proceeding.

. `# bash ~/dux/src/install_dux.sh`
** If there's issues: run with `DEBUG=1` (put before `bash`) for more verbose logs.
